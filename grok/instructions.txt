Instructions:

I'm playing two person cribbage.  I want a python program that will help me choose the optimal cards to put
in the kitty.  The program should take as input:
- the six cards in my hand
- number of simulations

The goal is to figure out the best possible kitty cards, where the kitty is 2 cards removed from the 6.
The program will loop over all 15 kitty combinations.
For each possible kitty, the program will run a number of simulations. In each simulation:
- Randomly choose a "top" or "starter" card that players share
- randomly choose 4 cards for the opponent's hand.
- play the first round, where players alternate, and there are points for adding up to 15, 31,
  getting a pair, run, and other normal cribbage rules
- repeat the first round for every given possible combination of playing my cards and my
  opponent's cards. there should be 576 combinations.
  - Store the maximum (best) score as round1_max
- play the second round (the count) and count the score in the hand.
  - store the score as round2
For each possible kitty, calculate the average total score (sum of round1_max + round_2)

Once all kitties are done, print the top 5 kitties, along with their average round 1 and round 2 scores
